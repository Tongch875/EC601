## Phase 1

## Twitter API -- Tong Chang

This is my first time to learn and use API. Firstly, I created a Twitter account. Secondly, I created a developer account which can be accessed by tweepy. Thirdly, 
I copied the access tokens and passwords. Finally, use API library functions to call the parameters, create a list to save the API date. I tried to use the search function 
to find some tweets based on keywords like "Canada", "France","swimming", and the program will give me the result. I feel I am using the twitter searching machine from 
python. 
So now I know how to use a searching machine with python without actually creating one. This will be helpful for machine learning.
